# 2025-12-25 Log — Project: Customer Data & Quotation System

## 📌 Context
Received a new request from the Design Department regarding company customer information in quotations.  
This is the first time since the project started that I’ve seen full customer information provided.  
Previously, when building the master data, the Sales Department did not supply complete company details, so we had to decide what data was suitable ourselves.  

Previously, when preparing quotations for the Sales Department, the requirement was to ensure that company information in the documents was rewritten in a more formal manner, particularly for export files sent to customers. Using names directly from the master data could appear disrespectful, so we proposed a workflow where users would select the company and then input a formal name. However, this suggestion was not accepted.

## 👥 Stakeholders
- Design Department (new request)  
- Sales Department (previously incomplete data)  
- End users (quotation handling, customer communication)  

## ⚠️ Problem
- Company information in quotations must be formal for customer-facing documents.  
- Current approach risks disrespecting customers if names are pulled directly from master data.  
- Previous suggestion (select company → input formal name) was rejected.  
- This leads to duplicate data and ineffective data usage.  
- End users are accustomed to Excel and resist adapting to the new system, reducing cooperation.

## 🔧 How I Handled It
- Linked the new request to the earlier issue of incomplete master data.  
- Documented the risks of using raw master data in quotations.  
- Planned to re-ask and persuade the Design Department staff to reconsider my suggestion, emphasizing system efficiency and data consistency.  

## 🛠️ Environment
- Quotation system with export functionality  
- Customer - Master data management  
- End-user workflows (Excel vs. new system)

## 📊 Outcome
- Issue raised again by Design Department, showing ongoing concern.  
- No immediate resolution yet, but opportunity to revisit and advocate for a better solution.  

## 🎯 Lessons Learned
- Incomplete master data creates downstream problems in formal customer communication.  
- Suggestions to improve data handling may be rejected initially but can be revisited with new stakeholders.  
- User resistance often comes from habit (Excel), not necessarily from system flaws.  
- Persistence and clear explanation are needed to persuade departments to adopt better practices.  

## 📌 Next Steps
- Re-engage with Design Department staff to advocate for the “select company → input formal name” workflow.  
- Highlight risks of duplicate and ineffective data usage.  
- Explore ways to ease end-user transition from Excel to the new system.

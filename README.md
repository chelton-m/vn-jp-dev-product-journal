# VN–JP Dev Product Journal

## 📌 Overview
This repository is my personal journal and portfolio documenting the journey of building internal systems for a **Japanese manufacturing company** while working from **Vietnam**.  
It captures not only **technical challenges** but also **end-user expectations and cultural standards** that shape how software is used in Japan.

## 👤 My Role
- **Requirement Analyst & Handler**: Collect requests from end users, analyze them, create test cases, and prioritize tasks based on business needs.  
- **User Representative**: Join meetings to capture the wishes and expectations of Japanese end users, ensuring their voice is reflected in the system.  
- **Software Developer**: Implement features, fix bugs, and design system flows.  
- **Observer of End-User Standards**: Document how Japanese users expect screens, reports, and workflows to look and behave.  

## 🛠 Team Setup
- 2 developers (Vietnam, no Japanese language skills)  
- 1 translator (non-technical background)  
- End users in Japan (staffs in Manufacturing Company)  

## ⚙️ Challenges
- Requirements are often vague or delayed.  
- Translator cannot clarify technical details.  
- Communication gaps due to language and cultural differences.  
- End users have **unique standards for screen layouts and workflows** that differ from typical Western design.  

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repo
- Share **daily technical experiences**.  
- Document **Japanese end-user conventions** for software screens and workflows.  
- Build a portfolio that reflects growth in **technical execution, requirement handling, and cultural UX insights**.
